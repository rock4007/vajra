# VAJRA – Shakti Kavach Prototype

## Overview
VAJRA (Shakti Kavach) is a **technology-assisted women safety and evidence preservation system** designed to prevent the silent burial of sexual assault and violent harassment cases.

The system focuses on **immediate evidence preservation**, **delay transparency**, and **lawful escalation support**, without overriding police or judicial authority.

---

## Problem
Many crimes go unreported or are delayed due to fear, power imbalance, and social pressure.  
The first few hours are critical — evidence is often lost, and delay leaves no trace.

---

## What This Prototype Demonstrates
- Distress detection (simulated motion/audio)
- Immediate cryptographic evidence sealing
- Time-stamped incident creation
- Delay audit after 120 hours (non-coercive)

## What This System Does NOT Do
- Does NOT auto-register FIRs
- Does NOT bypass police authority
- Does NOT publicly expose anyone

---

## Architecture (Simplified)
1. Sensor trigger (motion/audio/breathing)
2. Evidence sealed with SHA-256
3. Incident packet generated
4. Delay tracked transparently
